# Predictive-Analysis-of-Sales-Trends

Predictive analytics models are designed to assess historical data, discover patterns, observe trends, and use that information to predict future trends. Popular predictive analytics models include classification, clustering, and time series models

Predictive analytics is the use of data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data. It can help sales teams to forecast demand, optimize pricing, identify opportunities, and improve customer satisfaction.

Five Strategies To Effectively Analyse Sales Trends And Performance
Conduct an overall sales performance analysis. ...
Drill down data based on factorisation. ...
Determine the cannibalisation rate. ...
Conduct a diagnostic sales analysis. ...
Analyse customer feedback.
Typically, historical data is used to build a mathematical model that captures important trends. That predictive model is then used on current data to predict what will happen next, or to suggest actions to take for optimal outcomes.

The most advanced way to forecast your sales is by using causal models. These use hard numbers and mathematical formulae to identify relationships between the different factors that can affect your sales figures. A causal model uses results from a time-series analysis and a market survey
The most common predictive models include decision trees, regressions (linear and logistic), and neural networks, which is the emerging field of deep learning methods and technologies.
What is the formula for sales trend?
Linear sales trend formula is stated as "Y = a + b * X" where "b" is the periodic average increase/decrease amount. "b" is the "Linear growth rate". Note that "X" is the time periods and "Y" is the sales figures.
Sales trends and patterns are the movements and changes in your sales performance over time, such as growth, decline, seasonality, cycles, or anomalies. They can reveal important information about your customer behavior, preferences, needs, and satisfaction.
